## Discussion

I used the following technologies: JSX, CSS, React, React-Leaflet, and GeoJSON.
I used [create-react-app](https://goo.gl/26jfy4)
to generate the scaffolding for this app.

## Requirements

### 1. Build and react-leaflet app and add GeoJSON data from a third party API with a menu to toggle data. 
### 2. Add a menu with two buttons "Add Data" and "Remove Data" to add and remove GeoJSON bike data
### 3. Be able to cluster data as the user zooms out

## Bonus 

### Add pie chart from "Theft", "Crash", and "Hazard" data from bikewise API
